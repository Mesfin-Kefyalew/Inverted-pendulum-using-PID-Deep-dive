# PID control of inverted pendulum

In this project, I used the sympy package in python to establish the dynamic model of an inverted pendulum with a mass m, hinged on a box with a mass, M. After establishing the dynamic motion formulae for theta and x using the control package to find the actual transfer function.

Using a for loop and observing the performance of each transfer function with varying coefficients I was able to ball park the parameters which can stabilize theta around 0 degrees.
